    <p>Hey everyone! Let me tell you a little bit about me. I'm from Tucson,
        Arizona. I am married and we have 7 kids; 1
        girl and 6 boys. My oldest is married and I have a missionary serving in
        Indiana. We stay busy with sports,
        school stuff and having fun. I'm currently a stay at home mom and
        student. I'm absolutely loving both!</p>
    <p>As for school, I'm planning to learn more about web development and
        programming. I'm taking this class because I
        really want to learn more about web development. I think I'd eventually
        love to make it into a career. I like
        the creative aspect to it. Also, I feel it could be a job with some
        flexibility, which is important to me.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church my whole life. I really enjoyed this
        last general conference a lot. One of my
        favorite scriptures is D&C 6:34. "Therefore, fear not, little flock; do
        good; let earth and hell combine against
        you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail."</p>
    <p>Well, there you go...a little bit about me. I'm excited to get to know
        everyone else a little better.</p>
