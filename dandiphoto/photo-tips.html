        <h1 class="page title">Simple Tips</h1> 
        <p class="intro"> We’re going to follow through on our title here…keep it simple. As you become more confident 
            and really get some pictures under your belt, there is so much more information and many more tips to learn. 
            But trust us, you can get some great photos with just knowing a few important things.
        </p> 
        <h2 class="headline">#1- Pay Attention</h2>
        <p>Pay attention to what you are looking at through the lens of your camera. Often times you see with 
            your eyes a big, huge scene but your camera is only capturing a part of that. 
            Pay attention to what picture you are actually capturing. Do you want that house in the background? 
            Does it appear that there is a light pole coming out of your subject’s head? 
            Do you really want a picture with the laundry on the sofa or just your daughter sitting on the couch? 
            Photography is a kind of art, so there isn’t a wrong way, but just make sure 
            you are making conscience decisions on what info you’re putting into your camera. Try to get rid of 
            things in the picture that could distract from your focus. A big, red bike on 
            the sidewalk or that sink full of dishes can really draw the eye away from what you were photographing.   
        </p>
        <div class="double-pic-grid">
            <div class="distractions">
                <img src="images/distractions2.jpg" alt="picture of girl with others in background">
                <h3>Distraction- man and girl in background</h3>
            </div> 
            <div class="fixed-distractions">
                <img src="images/removed_distractions.jpg" alt="close-up picture of a girl">
                <h3>Removed distractions by taking close-up picture</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="headline">#2- Framing Your Subject</h2>
        <p>Where your subject is placed in your picture is important. Too high, too low or too far off to one 
            side can really ruin the look of you photo. No, you don’t always want your subject 
            right in the middle. It can sometimes look great to have them off center. However, certain pictures 
            definitely look best when centered, like a big group of people, for example. 
            Framing your subject can be a fun thing to experiment with, just make sure you are aware of where 
            your subject is in the picture. If you are unsure about framing, start with centering 
            your subject in the middle. It’s a great place to begin. 
        </p>
        <div class="double-pic-grid">
            <div class="single-framing">
                <img src="images/framing.jpg" alt="picture of toddler holding a popsicle">
                <h3>Subject is centered</h3>
            </div> 
            <div class="double-framing">
                <img src="images/two_boys.jpg" alt="picture of two boys">
                <h3>One subject on each side of center</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="headline">#3- Lighting</h2>
        <p>Lighting is one of the most important aspects of photography. As a beginner, start with lots of light. 
            Night time shots are more difficult and you might get discouraged with too dark or blurry pictures.
            Please note that “lots of light” does not mean in the middle of the day, right under the sun. That kind 
            of harsh lighting is harder to work with and often doesn’t make for very good pictures. 
        </p>
        <div class="single-pic-grid">
            <div class="harsh-lighting">
                <img src="images/harsh_light.jpg" alt="image of boy with shadows on face">
                <h3>Harsh lighting- shadows on face</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>When you are starting out, it is best to have the light on the side of the subject that you are trying to 
            capture. (For example, the light may be coming from BEHIND YOU, onto your subject’s face.) 
            As a beginner, it’s best to not have the brightest light behind your subject. This causes your subject to 
            appear dark in the picture with your background often much brighter. It really takes the focus
            away and makes it harder to see the subject. Just turn them around and you often get a very different picture. 
        </p>
        <div class="double-pic-grid">
            <div class="light-behind">
                <img src="images/poor_lighting.jpg" alt="picture of man with bad lighting">
                <h3>Light behind subject</h3>
            </div> 
            <div class="light-on">
                <img src="images/fixed_lighting.jpg" alt="picture of man">
                <h3>Light shining on subject</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>If the light is on their face but it’s too bright for your subject to look towards and they are squinting, 
            just turning them a few degrees right or left can really help the picture to turn out better. 
            If the subject is squinting, you may want to take the photos in the shade of a nearby patio or tree where 
            the lighting would probably be better.
            </p>
        <div class="single-pic-grid">
            <div class="patio">
                <img src="images/patio_light.jpg" alt="image of boy">
                <h3>Picture taken in patio shade</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>If you are taking pictures inside, just make sure you have enough light coming in from windows or lights. 
            Natural light usually makes great photos. Open the blinds and pull back the curtains. However, 
            direct light isn’t always the best. If the sun is shining directly in your room, put the subject near the 
            light but not necessarily right in the sunbeam. 
            Pay attention to shadows on your subject. Sometimes people put their subject under a tree so the lighting 
            isn’t harsh but then they get hundreds of tiny leaf shadows all of the subject’s face and body. 
            Also, sometimes a baseball cap creates a shadow so that you can’t see the person’s face. Maybe turn the hat 
            around or find a setting where the light isn’t coming from above. 
        </p>
        <p>And that's it. These tips will get you off to a great start!</p>
