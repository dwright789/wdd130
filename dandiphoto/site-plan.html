        It’s said that a picture says a thousand words. We agree! Photography is a wonderful and helpful way to express emotions, ideas, freeze a moment in time, and create pictures that can be 
        useful in various projects for personal or work-related purpose.
        Photography is an excellent hobby and is very beginner friendly. REALLY! Anyone can do it. All you need to get started is a camera, it can even be a phone camera. Once you’ve got your 
        chosen device, you’re ready to go!
        But wait! We’ve got some simple and helpful tips for you to help take your photos from OK to GREAT! Just following these few, easy steps can really make a BIG difference in your photography.
        We suggest you start with our “Simple Tips” and then move onto our “Fun Photography Ideas” when you are ready to mix things up.

      <h3>Simple Tips</h3>
      <p>
        We’re going to follow through on our title here…keep it simple. As you become more confident and really get some pictures under your belt, there is so much more information and many more tips to learn. 
        But trust us, you can get some great photos with just knowing a few important things.
        #1- Pay Attention
        Pay attention to what you are looking at through the lens of your camera. Often times you see with your eyes a big, huge scene but your camera is only capturing a part of that. 
        Pay attention to what picture you are actually capturing. Do you want that house in the background?  Does it appear that there is a light pole coming out of your subject’s head? 
        Do you really want a picture with the laundry on the sofa or just your daughter sitting on the couch? Photography is a kind of art, so there isn’t a wrong way, but just make sure 
        you are making conscience decisions on what info you’re putting into your camera. Try to get rid of things in the picture that could distract from your focus. A big, red bike on 
        the sidewalk or that sink full of dishes can really draw the eye away from what you were photographing.  
        #2- Framing your subject
        Where your subject is placed in your picture is important. Too high, too low or too far off to one side can really ruin the look of you photo. No, you don’t always want your subject 
        right in the middle. It can sometimes look great to have them off center. However, certain pictures definitely look best when centered, like a big group of people, for example. 
        Framing your subject can be a fun thing to experiment with, just make sure you are aware of where your subject is in the picture. If you are unsure about framing, start with centering 
        your subject in the middle. It’s a great place to begin. 
        #3- Lighting-
        Lighting is one of the most important aspects of photography. As a beginner, start with lots of light. Night time shots are more difficult and you might get discouraged with too dark or blurry pictures.
        Please note that “lots of light” does not mean in the middle of the day, right under the sun. That kind of harsh lighting is harder to work with and often doesn’t make for very good pictures. 
        When you are starting out, it is best to have the light on the side of the subject that you are trying to capture. (For example, the light may be coming from BEHIND YOU, onto your subject’s face.) 
        As a beginner, it’s best to not have the brightest light behind your subject. This causes your subject to appear dark in the picture with your background often much brighter. It really takes the focus
        away and makes it harder to see the subject. Just turn them around and you often get a very different picture. 
        If the light is on their face but it’s too bright for your subject to look towards and they are squinting, just turning them a few degrees right or left can really help the picture to turn out better. 
        If the subject is squinting, you may want to take the photos in the shade of a nearby patio or tree where the lighting would probably be better.
        If you are taking pictures inside, just make sure you have enough light coming in from windows or lights. Natural light usually makes great photos. Open the blinds and pull back the curtains. However, 
        direct light isn’t always the best. If the sun is shining directly in your room, put the subject near the light but not necessarily right in the sunbeam. 
        Pay attention to shadows on your subject. Sometimes people put their subject under a tree so the lighting isn’t harsh but then they get hundreds of tiny leaf shadows all of the subject’s face and body. 
        Also, sometimes a baseball cap creates a shadow so that you can’t see the person’s face. Maybe turn the hat around or find a setting where the light isn’t coming from above. 
        
        And that's it. These tips will get you off to a great start!

      <h3>Fun Photography Ideas</h3>
      <p>
        #1 Get up close. Instead of getting a shot of the whole scene, zoom in or just simply move in closer. 
        #2 Try a different angle. Sometimes straight on is perfect for what you want, but taking the picture from the side, from above, or down low can really make it better. 
        #3 Take some action shots. Pictures of people running or jumping can be fun!
        #4 Silhouettes- in our “Simple Tips” we said to put the light on the front of the subject. For silhouettes, you want the light behind your subject. A sunset is a great time for this.
        #5 Take photos of something that isn’t your usual subject. If you normally take pictures of your kids, try photographing the tree out your window. If you normally focus on the flowers
         in your garden, try taking pictures of a big storm rolling in. This is a great way to learn new things by experimenting.
