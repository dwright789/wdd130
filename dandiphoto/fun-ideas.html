            <h2 class="headline">#1- Get up close</h2>
            <p>Instead of getting a shot of the whole scene, zoom in or just
                simply move in closer. It's amazing how different things look
                when you really get up close. You can see so many details.
            </p>

            </div>
            <h2 class="headline">#2- Try a different angle</h2>
            <p>Sometimes straight on is perfect for what you want, but taking
                the picture from the side, from above, or down low can really
                make it better.

            <h2 class="headline">#3- Take some action shots</h2>
            <p>Pictures of people running or jumping can be fun! You may find
                yourself shoot a lot of these kinds of pictures hoping to get
                just one good shot out of the whole lot, but it's so rewarding
                when you finally get a great action picture.
            </p>

            <h2 class="headline">#4- Silhouettes</h2>
            <p>In our “Simple Tips” we said to put the light on the front of the
                subject. For silhouettes, you want the light behind your
                subject. A sunset is a great time for this.
            </p>

                <div class="silhouette">

                        alt="silhouette of people in front of sunset">
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2 class="headline">#5- Try something new</h2>
            <p>Take photos of something that isn’t your usual subject. If you
                normally take pictures of your kids, try photographing the tree
                out your window. If you normally focus on the flowers
                in your garden, try taking pictures of a big storm rolling in.
                This is a great way to learn new things by experimenting.
